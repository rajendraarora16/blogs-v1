<strong>What is Data Structure?<strong>

A way of organizing the data in such a way so that can be used efficiently.

<strong>Difference between Linear and non-linear data structure:</strong>

**Linear**

 - If an element form a sequence or a linear list. It is said to be Linear. *E.g:* Array, LinkedList, Stack and Queues.
 - Traversal are Linear.

**Non-linear** 

 - Traversal of node is non-linear in nature then it is said to be non-linear. *E.g:* Tree, graphs.
