Hi, I am focused on Front End in javascript as well as Back End focused on Node.js development. 

Today I spend most of my day working with bleeding edge front end as well as back end technologies and concepts like React, node.js, functional programming and immutability. But I am not limited to these.

I work daily with a Mac, Unix based OS, GIT and Docker/Vagrant environment. Also I am huge fan of Machine Learning.
